Especially, "librrd-dev" is reuired to build SmartPi tools.
	sudo apt-get install librrd-dev rrdtool git i2c-tools avahi-daemon

Test if i2c is correctly enabled
	i2cdetect -l
	> i2c-1   i2c             20804000.i2c                            I2C adapter

Install go
Download the archive and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go.
Currently version 1.7.3 is up to date. You may need to adapt the filenamy according to latest version.
	cd /usr/local
	sudo wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
	sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.7.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
	sudo rm go1.7.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz

Add "/usr/local/go/bin" to the PATH environment variable.
You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) before the path is being exported.
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

Create a directory to contain your workspace and SmartPi git-repo, $HOME/SmartPi in this case,
and set the GOPATH environment variable to point to that location.
